                    The beautiful island it is a surprising place thanks to recurrent and priceless blooms art treasures that blend in a harmonious microcosm. Transformed from rock to flowered garden today the island appears as a vessel that floats on the blue waters of the Lake Maggiore as well as in the intent of its founder Vitaliano VI Borromeo. Visiting this place will allow you to immerse yourself for a day in a bygone era where the baroque taste mixes virtuously with the green architecture of the garden creating a marriage that has no equal. The Isola Bella palace is a treasure chest ofbaroque art suspended on the water.

                    Until 1632 the island was a rocky crag occupied by a tiny fishing village: but that year Carlo III of the influential House of Borromeo began the construction of a palazzo dedicated to his wife, Isabella D'Adda, from whom the island takes its name. He entrusted the works to the Milanese Angelo Crivelli, who was also to be responsible for the planning the gardens. The works were interrupted around middle of the century when the Duchy of Milan was struck by a devastating outbreak of the plague.
                    Construction resumed when the island passed to Carlo’s sons, Cardinal Giberto III (1615–1672) and Vitaliano VI (1620–1690); the latter in particular, with the financial backing of his elder brother, entrusted the completion of the works to the Milanese architect Carlo Fontana and turned the villa into a place of sumptuous parties and theatrical events for the nobility of Europe.
                    The completion of the gardens, however, was left to his nephew Carlo IV (1657–1734). They were inaugurated in 1671.
                    The island achieved its highest level of social success during the period of Giberto V Borromeo (1751–1837) when guests included Edward Gibbon, Napoleon and his wife Joséphine de Beauharnais, and Caroline of Brunswick, the Princess of Wales. It is said that Caroline, having fallen in love with the place, did her best to convince the Borromeo family to sell her Isola Madre or the Castelli di Cannero islands; her request being turned down, she established herself on the banks of Lake Como at Cernobbio in the Villa d’Este.
                    A conference of high representatives of Italy, France and the United Kingdom was held in the palace at Isola Bella in April 1935, resulting in the agreement known as the Stresa Front.
